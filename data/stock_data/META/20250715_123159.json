    "recommendation": "RECOMMENDATION: HOLD - Based on the technical analysis, META's current price is slightly above the 20-day MA and RSI is at a neutral level. The positive sentiment in news articles suggests a potential upside. With a moderate risk-reward profile and current holding at a slight profit, it may be prudent to hold onto existing shares unless there is a significant shift in market conditions.\n\nSpecific action if holding shares: Hold onto your current position but monitor closely for any changes in technical indicators or news sentiment that may warrant a different action in the future.",
