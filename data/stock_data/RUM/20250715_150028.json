However, the RSI is not indicating overbought or oversold conditions. The positive news sentiment is a good sign, but with sentiment data being quite old, it may not fully reflect the current market sentiment. With a small profit already realized and a stop loss threshold in place, it may be prudent to hold onto the current position until clearer signals emerge.\n[AI Analysis: 14:57:37 UTC]",
