    "recommendation": "RECOMMENDATION: HOLD - Based on the technical analysis, the current price is trading around the 20-day MA and the RSI is neutral, indicating a sideways trend. The positive news sentiment adds some support to the overall outlook. With a relatively small current holding, it may be prudent to hold and monitor for clearer buy or sell signals.\n\nThe risk management parameters suggest a -10.0% stop loss threshold, providing downside protection, and a 20.0% take profit threshold for potential gains. Given the current position is slightly in the green, holding allows for potential profit without taking on excessive risk.\n\nIf holding shares, consider setting a stop loss at -10.0% to protect gains and reassess the position as new data becomes available. Keep an eye on any significant changes in technical indicators or news sentiment for potential buying or selling opportunities.\n[AI Analysis: 14:56:11 UTC]",
