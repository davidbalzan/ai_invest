  "data": "RECOMMENDATION: BUY - The current price of INTC is above the 20-day and 50-day moving averages, implying an ongoing upward trend. The RSI is neutral, and the MACD value is above the signal, both suggesting bullish momentum. The positive news sentiment further supports the positive outlook. Additional volume confirmation would strengthen the signal, but the present conditions indicate potential for upside. The risk/reward ratio aligns favorably with our risk management parameters given the current low volatility.\n\n\ud83d\udd0d DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT:\nStatus: EXCELLENT (Reliability: 85.0%)\nWARNINGS:\n\u26a0\ufe0f Data is 32.9 hours old\n\n[AI Analysis: 12:51:53 UTC | Confidence: 65.0% | Data Quality: EXCELLENT]",
