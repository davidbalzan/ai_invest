    "recommendation": "RECOMMENDATION: HOLD - Despite the overbought RSI, the MACD signal remains strong and the positive news sentiment suggests a potential upside. However, be cautious of the potential for a pullback, so maintaining current holdings with a stop loss at -10% may be prudent given the risk/reward profile. Continuously monitor the technical indicators and news sentiment for any significant changes.",
