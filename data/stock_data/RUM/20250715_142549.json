News sentiment is positive, but the sentiment data is quite old. Considering your current P&L and risk management thresholds, it may be prudent to hold onto your existing shares for now. Continue to monitor technical indicators and news sentiment for any significant changes.\n[AI Analysis: 14:25:47 UTC]",
