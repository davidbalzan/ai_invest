However, the positive sentiment score and overall positive news sentiment indicate good prospects for the company. With a solid risk management strategy in place, it may be prudent to hold onto current shares and reassess the situation as more fresh sentiment data becomes available.\n[AI Analysis: 12:51:33 UTC]",
