The positive news sentiment adds some support, but with a sentiment score on the lower side and old data, holding for now is advisable. Given your current P&L and risk tolerance, maintaining your current position is a prudent move until there is more clarity in the market and sentiment data is updated.\n[AI Analysis: 13:02:22 UTC]",
