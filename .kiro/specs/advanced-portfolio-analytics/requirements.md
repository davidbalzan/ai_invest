# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for enhancing the existing AI Investment Tool with advanced portfolio analytics, real-time monitoring capabilities, and intelligent automation features. The system currently provides a sophisticated foundation with FastAPI web server (v2.0.0), PostgreSQL database with comprehensive models for users, portfolios, holdings, transactions, and analysis sessions, intelligent multi-layer caching system, and AI-powered analysis capabilities. This enhancement will build upon the existing architecture to add advanced portfolio optimization, real-time monitoring, automated rebalancing, and comprehensive risk management capabilities.
